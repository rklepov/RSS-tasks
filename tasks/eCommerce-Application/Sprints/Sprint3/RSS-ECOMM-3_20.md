#### Description

To enhance the user experience, implement routing and browser navigation that allows users to navigate to the User Profile page.

#### Implementation Details

1. **User Profile Page:** This page should display information about a user's profile.
2. **Routing:** The URL in the browser should change when users navigate to the User Profile page and when they navigate away from it. The User Profile page should have a unique URL that can be directly accessed.
