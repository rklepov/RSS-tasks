## Sprint 4: Basket Page, Catalog Page Enhancements, and About Us Page Implementation

In this sprint, the team will concentrate on enhancing the Detailed Product Page, building the Basket page, and further enhancing the Catalog page. These enhancements will include features such as a comprehensive view of a product with the option to add or remove the product from the cart, increase or decrease the quantity of the product, and display a clear indicator if the product is already in the user's shopping cart.

The team will also work on features for the Basket page like displaying a list of items added to the basket, increasing or decreasing the quantity of each item, removing items from the basket, displaying the subtotal and total prices, and a button for proceeding to the checkout page.

For the Catalog page, we will implement interactive product cards and shopping cart integration. All these features should be built using the commercetools API for data retrieval and management. We will also implement performance optimization techniques such as lazy loading, pagination, or infinite scroll to handle a large number of products efficiently.

### Working with the Repository

- Create a new branch for the current sprint (e.g., `feat/sprint_4`) from the previous sprint's branch (`feat/sprint_3`).
- Merge all feature branches into the current sprint's branch.
- At the end of the sprint, create a pull request from the current sprint's branch (`feat/sprint_4`) to the previous sprint's branch (`feat/sprint_3`).
- Share the pull request link with the mentor for review and evaluation.
