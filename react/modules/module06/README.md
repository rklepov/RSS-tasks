# Week 6

## React. SSR/SSG


!! Task should be implemented in the school’s private repository !!
It should be based on the previous task.

### What should be done:

1. Create a separate branch for this task.
2. Move your application to the server and enable server side rendering.
3. Hydrate your application on FE side.
4. Adopt Redux for SSR.
5. Add e2e tests for your application via cypress.

### Score
The task will be checked during cross-check and cross-code-review.  
Student can get 15 points if the following requirements are met:
1. Eslint should not show any errors or warnings. 
2. All the functionality should work.
3. No console errors in browser.
4. E2E test coverage should be not less than 80%.

If at least one of the requirements is not completed, then the task is evaluated as **0 points**.

The score might be less, if:
1. Part of functionality doesn't work.
2. renderToPipeableStream method haven't been used.
2. Redux doesn't work.
3. E2E test coverage is below than 80%.
### Repository requirements

- the task should be done in the school's **private repository** [How to work with a private repository](https://docs.rs.school/#/private-repository?id=Как-работать-с-приватным-репозиторием) [RU]
- create a branch with the name of the current task in the school's private repository from the branch of the previous task.
- the commit history should display the development process of the application. [Commit-name-requirements](https://docs.rs.school/#/git-convention?id=Требования-к-именам-коммитов) [RU]
- after the development is completed, it is necessary to make a Pull Request from the application branch to the branch of the previous task [Requirements for a Pull Request](https://docs.app.rs.school/#/platform/pull-request-review-process). **DO NOT MERGE this Pull Request from the development branch into the previous task branch**
